#### Description
The derelict on LV-426, codenamed Origin and also known as the alien derelict,[1] was a crashed Engineer Juggernaut. Some time in 2122, a warning signal being broadcast from the derelict was detected by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation and the commercial hauler USCSS Nostromo was subsequently sent to investigate, without the knowledge of its crew. The ship was believed to have crashed on LV-426 several millennia prior to the arrival of the Nostromo.
  The derelict was thought to have been destroyed in 2179 when the Atmosphere Processing Plant at the nearby colony of Hadley's Hope exploded, but it in fact survived the blast and was later home to an extensive Weyland-Yutani research camp, known as the Origin Facility.
